This connector was built in the absence of AWS cloudwatch connector in the marketplace. I have had several use cases where we need to publish logs to AWS Cloudwatch for longer retentions, better search and better analysis.


We are planning to add other sub-services of AWS Cloudwatch as connector operations in the coming releases.

The connector uses AWS Java SDK 1.x version to connect to AWS Cloudwatch service.
