== Introduction

This connector was built in the absence of AWS cloudwatch connector in the marketplace. I have had several use cases where we need to publish logs to AWS Cloudwatch for longer retentions, better search and better analysis.

We are planning to add other sub-services of AWS Cloudwatch as connector operations in the coming releases.

== Mule supported versions
Mule 4.2.x or higher versions

=== Prerequisites

This document assumes you are familiar with Mule, link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/anypoint-connectors[Anypoint Connectors],
and link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/anypoint-studio-essentials[Anypoint Studio Essentials]. To increase your familiarity with Studio,
consider completing one or more link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/basic-studio-tutorial[Anypoint Studio Tutorials]. Further,
this page assumes that you have a basic understanding of link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/elements-in-a-mule-flow[Elements in a Mule Flow] and link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/global-elements[Mule Global Elements].

This document describes implementation examples within the context of Anypoint Studio, Mule ESBâ€™s graphical user interface, and, in parallel,
includes configuration details for doing the same in the XML Editor.

=== Dependencies

The connector uses link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/index.html[AWS Java SDK 1.x] version to connect to AWS Cloudwatch service.

== Installing and Configuring

=== Installing
You can install the connector with the help of Maven.

Maven dependency:
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.mulesoft-connectors</groupId>
    <artifactId>mule-aws-cloudwatch-connector</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <classifier>mule-plugin</classifier>
</dependency>

=== Configuring the Connector in a Flow

Follow these steps to configure the parameters of the connector in a flow:

. Drag the connector onto the canvas, then select it to open the Properties Editor console.

1. After you install the connector, it will appear in your mule pallete.
2. Simply drag and drop the connector in to the canvas.
3. After that you need to configure the connector.
4. Click on the connector and go to the Mule Properties tab
5. Click on the add icon in front of the "Connector Configurations" drop down
6. Enter correct configuration details in the fields. Normally, it is recommended to create a IAM Service user in your aws account and assing only cloudwatch access. If needed, provide only access to the particular log group and stream.
7. It is recommended to configure the credentials in the properties and user the as reference in these fields.
